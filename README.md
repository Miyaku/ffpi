# FFPI *{Beta}*
Flashable Fonts Patch Installer (Beta)

# The Idea..
Fonts pack for android (flashable) need more than 3 .ttf font files on /system/fonts (short story is extrack to system fonts).

# The works..
Duplicates 3 font type "Reguler" "Italic" & "Bold" > Rename to Roboto, etc etc > Compress and flash.<br />
Why not duplicate and rename font via recovery? 

# Use Scripts..
You can get more than time to copy one by one and rename.. (auto vs manual)<br />
You just push 3 fonts and will be duplicate auto<br />
And more than it.. you can feel..
