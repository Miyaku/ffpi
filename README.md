# FFPI *{Beta}*
Flashable Fonts Patch Installer (Beta)

# The Idea..
Fonts pack for android (flashable) need more than 3 .ttf font files on <code>/system/fonts</code> *(short story is extrack to system fonts)*.

# The works..
Duplicates 3 font type "Reguler" "Italic" & "Bold" > Rename to Roboto, etc etc > Compress and flash.<br />
***Why not duplicate and rename font via recovery? 

# Use Scripts..
You can get more than time to copy one by one and rename.. (auto vs manual)<br />
You just push 3 fonts and will be duplicate auto<br />
And more than it.. you can feel..

# How the Scripts Work..
This scripts will check the fonts on folder /fonts/ *(in zip)* and will duplicate and configuring name and font type by Android Versions.<br />
1) Finding 1 name fonts (Regular) and force to type (Regular, Light, Bold, Italic) to /system/fonts/<br />
2) Finding 3 name fonts *(in zip)* (Bold, Italic, Regular) and configuring to type fonts in /system/fonts/<br />
3) Checking all fonts *(in zip)* if name match will be reconfigure on new font type, like Black, Medium, Thin etc. and will push to /system/fonts/<br />

## So Simple Right? ðŸ˜Ž

# Now What?
Now you can search font you like on <a href="//google.com/fonts/">Google Fonts</a> or <a href="www.dafont.com">Dafont</a> or whatever, Download and unzip font pack. Move all .ttf font to this folder /fonts/ compress as zip and flash to your devices.
